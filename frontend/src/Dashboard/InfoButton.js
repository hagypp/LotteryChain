                <p>
                  This is a blockchain-based lottery game where the flow of each round is strictly governed by block numbers:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Lottery Start</strong><br />
                    When a new lottery round begins, the smart contract records the current block number as the starting point.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Entry Window (BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE)</strong><br />
                    From the starting block, users have a limited number of blocks (defined by BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE) to enter the lottery by selecting 6 numbers between 1‚Äì37 and 1 strong number between 1‚Äì7.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Lottery Closing</strong><br />
                    Once the current block exceeds the entry period, the lottery can be closed. This can be done:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Manually by any user.</li>
                      <li>Automatically by the contract, triggered by specific user actions (see below).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Draw Window (BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_DRAW)</strong><br />
                    After the lottery is closed, there is a second waiting period (defined by BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_DRAW) before the draw. Once this period has passed, anyone can trigger the draw to pick the winning numbers.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Prize Distribution</strong><br />
                  Winners are determined based on how many numbers they matched, and prizes are paid automatically by the smart contract. The prize pool is transparent from the start, with a fee deducted for the smart contract owner. Players who correctly guess all 6 numbers and the strong number win the big prize, while those who guess only the 6 numbers win a smaller prize. If multiple winners exist for a prize tier, the prize is divided equally among them.                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Special Cases and Automatic Behavior</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Users can <strong>buy a ticket</strong> at any time, even after the entry window has closed.
                    <ul>
                      <li>If a user buys a ticket after BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE, the ticket is purchased successfully, but the lottery is <strong>automatically closed immediately afterward</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>If a user tries to <strong>enter a ticket</strong> (select numbers) after the entry window has closed, the ticket is rejected and the lottery is <strong>automatically closed</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This ensures the system always progresses without requiring manual intervention.</p>
