            <p>
              This is a blockchain-based lottery game where the flow of each round is strictly governed by block numbers:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Lottery Start</strong><br />
                When a new lottery round begins, the smart contract records the current block number as the starting point.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Entry Window (BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE)</strong><br />
                From the starting block, users have a limited number of blocks defined by <strong>BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE {contractData.BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE !== null 
                      ? `= ${contractData.BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE}` : ''} </strong>) to enter the lottery by selecting 6 numbers between 1‚Äì37 and 1 strong number between 1‚Äì7.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Lottery Closing</strong><br />
                Once the current block exceeds the entry period, the lottery can be closed. This can be done:
                <ul>
                  <li>Manually by any user.</li>
                  <li>Automatically by the contract, triggered by specific user actions (see below).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Draw Window (BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_DRAW)</strong><br />
                     After the lottery is closed, there is a second waiting period (defined by <strong>BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_DRAW {contractData.BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_DRAW !== null 
                      ? `= ${contractData.BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_DRAW}` : ''}</strong> ) before the draw. Once this period has passed, anyone can trigger the draw to pick the winning numbers.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Prize Distribution</strong><br />
                Winners are determined based on how many numbers they matched, and prizes are paid automatically by the smart contract. The prize pool is transparent from the start, with a fee deducted for the smart contract owner  
                <strong>{contractData.commission !== null ? ` (${(contractData.commission)}% of the prize pool)` : ''}</strong>
                . Players who correctly guess all 6 numbers and the <strong>strong number</strong> win the <strong>big prize</strong> 
                <strong>{contractData.percentage_big !== null ? ` (${(contractData.percentage_big)}% of the prize pool)` : ''}</strong>
                       , while those who guess only the 6 numbers win a <strong>small prize</strong> 
                       <strong>{contractData.percentage_small !== null ? ` (${(contractData.percentage_small)}% of the prize pool)` : ''}</strong>
                       . If multiple winners exist for a prize tier, the prize is divided equally among them.
                    <p>
                    <strong>Mini Prize : </strong>
                      In every round, a <strong>mini prize</strong> is awarded, even if no one guesses the winning numbers. This prize is distributed among players who did not win any other prize 
                      <strong>{contractData.percentage_mini !== null ? ` (${(contractData.percentage_mini)}% of the prize pool)` : ''}</strong>
                      . The distribution uses a <strong>softmax function</strong> to assign higher chances to tickets that have been purchased earlier (based on the timestamp when the ticket was purchased).
                    </p>
                      <p>
                    <strong>Claim Prize : </strong>
                      Players can check their pending prizes and claim them at any time after the draw.
                    </p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>üîí Security and Number Handling</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
              As part of the design to ensure fairness and prevent manipulation, each player's selected numbers (6 regular and 1 strong) are not stored in plaintext on-chain. Instead, when a user buys a ticket, the chosen numbers are converted into a <strong>hashed value</strong> (using a secure hash function) and this hash is stored on the smart contract. This prevents anyone from seeing or tampering with the selections before the draw.
            </li>
            <li>
              On the server side, the winning numbers are generated using a secure AWS or cloud function (Lambda). This function returns only the <strong>hashed value</strong> of the winning combination. The comparison between the user‚Äôs ticket and the drawn numbers is then done via matching these hash values, ensuring <strong>integrity and security</strong> throughout the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, since the entire process is governed by <strong>block numbers</strong>, the system is resistant to <strong>front-running attacks</strong> or <strong>brute-force attempts</strong> to guess the winning combination hash. The timing and sequence of each phase are deterministic and verifiable on-chain.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Special Cases and Automatic Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Users can <strong>buy a ticket</strong> at any time, even after the entry window has closed.
                <ul>
                  <li>If a user buys a ticket after BLOCKS_TO_WAIT_FOR_CLOSE, the ticket is purchased successfully, but the lottery is <strong>automatically closed immediately afterward</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If a user tries to <strong>enter a ticket</strong> (select numbers) after the entry window has closed, the ticket is rejected and the lottery is <strong>automatically closed</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This ensures the system always progresses without requiring manual intervention.</p>
